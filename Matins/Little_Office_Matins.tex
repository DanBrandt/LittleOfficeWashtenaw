``Sts. Paul and Silas, being in prison praying, praised God at midnight, and then the earth quaked, and all the prison doors opened, and all fetters and bonds of prisoners were loosed. Our Lord Jesus Christ also prayed, not only in one part of the night, but all the night He woke in prayer, as the Gospel tells... furthermore, some say that for at the time of \textit{Matins}, there appeared a star in the firmament whereby shipmen are ruled in the sea, and bring themselves to right haven; and for our merciful Lady is that star which succours mankind in the troublesome sea of this world, and bringeth her lovers to the haven of health, therefore it is worthy that she be served and praised at the time of \textit{Matins}.'' (Paraphrased from the \textit{Mirror of Our Lady}.) O most Blessed Virgin, with you as the star we set our coruse on life's tempestuous seas, may we , like Sts. Paul and Silas, follow Our Lord's example and keep vigil in prayer, ever wakeful for His coming. Amen.

	let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, and with psalms rejoice before him.
	
	2. Hail Mary, full of grace:
	the Lord is with thee.
	
	3. For The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods: 
	
	4. The Lord will not cast off his people; 
	in his hands are all the ends of the earth, and he beholdeth the heights of the mountains.
	
	5. The Lord is with thee.
	
	6. The sea is his, and he made it, and his hands founded the dry land:
	
	7. {\color{red}\textit{(genuflect)}}  COME, LET US ADORE AND FALL DOWN BEFORE GOD; 
	{\color{red}\textit{(stand)}} let us lament before the Lord who made us;

	9. Hail Mary, full of grace:
	 the Lord is with thee.

	harden not your hearts,

	where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works.
	
	12. The Lord is with thee.
	
	13. Forty years long was I nigh unto this generation and said:
	They do always err in their heart
	
	14. For they have not known my ways:
	unto whom I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
	
	15. Haily Mary, full of grace,
	the Lord is with thee.
	
	16. {\color{red}\textit{(bow)}} Glory be to the Father, and to the Son:

	O'ershadowed by Almighty power;
	He whom the stars, and sun, and moon,
	Each serve in their appointed hour.
	
	3. O Mother blest! to whom was given
	Within thy body to contain
	The Architect of earth and heaven,
	Whose hand the universe sustain.

	In thee the Spirit was enshrine'd;
	Of thee was born that mighty one,
	The long-desir'd of all mankind.
